This is the first post I write on this blog. I have for a long time thought about starting to blog, mostly for my own sake. To be able to document what I do to be able to find my solutions later on.

In general, I like to test out different kind of software tools and environments, and I often struggle to get something to work, and when I finally do, I don't have the need to touch it for a long time. Then comes the day when I change computer or similar and find the same issue again, but now have forgotten how I once solved it. Hopefully I will remember to document things like that on this page and be able to quickly find it in the future. And, even better, if anyone else struggles with the same problem maybe this page could help, as I have been helped by the multiple pages out there.

As this is the first post, I might be suitable to talk about the tools I use to make this. Quite recently I stumbled upon the too [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is a tool to create static webpages with markdown. I was interested in this for multiple reasons, and thought it could be a nice tool to use for this kinds of purpuses.

I decided to host it for free on [Github](https://github.com/), if you are interested in how to do it, I can recommend this [page](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/mydoc_publishing_github_pages.html)
